## Code & building
Quite simple, clone the repo, place the below dependencies into a new **LSPDFR+/dependencies** folder. It should then build without issue.

The code requires some refactoring and optimization work which I do not currently have the time for.
If you feel like it, please feel free to contribute by submitting a Pull Request. 
They may make it into a release and, of course, you'll be credited appropriately.
Obviously, feel free to use this as a resource to learn from and improve your programming skills for RPH (credits appreciated, please see licence also if copying/using larger parts of the code).
